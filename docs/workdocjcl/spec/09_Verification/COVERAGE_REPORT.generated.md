generated: 2026-02-04T00:00:00Z

This file is a **skill template artifact** and is **not** the authoritative coverage proof for
this repository. It is intentionally kept as a breadcrumb showing why we do not rely on the
skill’s `verify_coverage.sh` output for Codex.

Authoritative coverage anchors:
- Contract/mapping anchor: `docs/workdocjcl/spec/09_Verification/CODE_TO_SPEC_MAP.md`
- No-omission file baseline: `docs/workdocjcl/inventory/file_manifest_repo.txt`
- Coverage narrative: `docs/workdocjcl/spec/09_Verification/COVERAGE_REPORT.md`
